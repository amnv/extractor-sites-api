# Extractor-sites-api
Personal project to practice the development of spring boot applications

### Database
This project uses Postgres database. To configure it I used this [tutorial](https://renatogroffe.medium.com/postgresql-docker-executando-uma-inst%C3%A2ncia-e-o-pgadmin-4-a-partir-de-containers-ad783e85b1a4) to create the database and the pgadmin in two different containers with Docker. It is not necessary to follow this tutorial, but it might help if you don't have postgres installed.
